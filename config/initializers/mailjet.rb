  # Mailjet API v3.1 is at the moment limited to Send API.
  # Weâ€™ve not set the version to it directly since there is no other endpoint in that version.
  # We recommend you create a dedicated instance of the wrapper set with it to send your emails.
  # If you're only using the gem to send emails, then you can safely set it to this version.
  # Otherwise, you can remove the dedicated line into config/initializers/mailjet.rb.
